AWS event triggering is used by big tech companies to send notifications
Let us take Netflix as consideration
- Whenever there is a new video uploaded in Netflix
  notification rings in to the subscribers mail
  This is done by using s3 notification triggering.
  
# Change in s3 bucket triggers the lambda function and the SNS service is used to send notification to the subscribers.
